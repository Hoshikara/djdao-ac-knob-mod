## PURPOSE
To bring the feel of DJ DAO's arcade knobs closer to Valkyrie Model knobs. This will be done by using ball bearings instead of the original plastic bushings. We will use custom parts that can accomodate ball bearings as it is not possible to fit them in the original knobs. The ball bearings are more durable, provide a much smoother turning feel, and are easier to replace (if ever needed) than the proprietary plastic bushings.

## DISCLAIMERS
- This mod utilizes the online laser cutting service [SendCutSend](https://sendcutsend.com/) which only ships to the US and Canada. If you live outside of these countries, you will need to find an alternative service to produce the parts.
- This mod is slightly destructive as the shaft of the knob assemblies require sanding to fit through one of the bearings.
- The custom top plate has oversized slots for the torque limiter tabs. This arcade accurate as opposed to the exact fit that the original top plate has.
- Approximate cost of materials is $90 USD at the time of writing.
- If you have access to a 3D printer, consider [this](https://github.com/arkeet/svre9-knob-mod) modifcation instead.
