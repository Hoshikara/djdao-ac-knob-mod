# PURPOSE
To bring the feel of DJ DAO's arcade knobs closer to Valkyrie Model knobs. This is done by replacing the original plastic bushings with ball bearings. As some of the original parts cannot fit these ball bearings, they are replaced with custom parts. The ball bearings are more durable, provide a much smoother turning feel, and are easier to replace (if ever needed) than the proprietary plastic bushings.

# DISCLAIMERS
- This mod is **not** intended for NEMSYS cabinet knobs as the mounting holes are not the same.
- This mod utilizes the online laser cutting service [SendCutSend](https://sendcutsend.com/) which only ships to the US and Canada. If you live outside of these countries, you will need to find an alternative service to produce the parts.
- This mod is slightly destructive as the shaft of the knob assemblies require sanding to fit through one of the bearings.
- The custom top plate has oversized slots for the torque limiter tabs. This is arcade accurate as opposed to the exact fit of the original top plate slots.
- The approximate cost of materials is $100 USD at the time of writing (May 2023).
- If you have access to a 3D printer, consider [this](https://github.com/arkeet/svre9-knob-mod) modifcation instead.

# ASSEMBLY

## Parts of interest:
- `1` is the U bracket, replace it with the custom U bracket.
- `2` is the bottom plastic bushing, replace it with a MF148ZZ ball bearing. The hole in the U bracket may require sanding to fit the bearing.
- `3` is the shaft of the assembly, sand this down **only enough** to fit through the MF106ZZ ball bearing.
- `8` is the top plate, replace it with the custom top plate.
- `9` is the top plastic bushing, replace it with a MF106ZZ ball bearing.
- `10` is a MISUMI WSJW10-6-2 Resin Washer, not completely necessary but recommended to space the knob from the top plate.
- `B` is a 7mm hex nut, use the 7mm socket wrench screwdriver to remove these.
- `C` is a knob set screw, use the 2mm hex key allen wrench to remove these.
- `D` is the shaft set screw, use the 1.5mm hex key allen wrench to remove these.
