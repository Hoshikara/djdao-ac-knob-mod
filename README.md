## PURPOSE
To bring the feel of DJ DAO's arcade knobs closer to Valkyrie Model knobs. This will be done by using ball bearings instead of the original plastic bushings. We will use custom parts that can accomodate ball bearings as it is not possible to fit them in the original knobs. The ball bearings are more durable, provide a much smoother turning feel, and are easier to replace (if ever needed) than the proprietary plastic bushings.

## DISCLAIMERS
- This mod utilizes the online laser cutting service [SendCutSend](https://sendcutsend.com/) which only ships to the US and Canada. If you live outside of these countries, you will need to find an alternative service to produce the parts.
- This mod is slightly destructive as the shaft of the knob assemblies require sanding to fit through one of the bearings.
- The custom top plate has oversized slots for the torque limiter tabs. This arcade accurate as opposed to the exact fit that the original top plate has.
- Approximate cost of materials is $90 USD at the time of writing.
- If you have access to a 3D printer, consider [this](https://github.com/arkeet/svre9-knob-mod) modifcation instead.

## ASSEMBLY

![Knob Assembly Exploded View](https://gamerepair.info/images/60_sound_voltex_volume_assembly)

#### Parts of interest:
- `1` is the U bracket, replace it with the custom U bracket.
- `2` is the bottom plastic bushing, replace it with a MF148ZZ ball bearing. The hole in the U bracket may require sanding to fit the bearing.
- `3` is the shaft of the assembly, sand this down **only enough** to fit through the MF106ZZ ball bearing.
- `8` is the top plate, replaced it with the custom top plate.
- `9` is the top plastic bushing, replace it with a MF106ZZ ball bearing.
- `10` is a MISUMI WSJW10-6-2 Resin Washer, not completely necessary but recommended to space the knob from the top plate.
- `B` is a 7mm hex nut, use the 7mm socket wrench screwdriver to remove these.
- `C` is a knob set screw, use the 2mm hex key allen wrench to remove these.
- `D` is the shaft set screw, use the 1.5mm hex key allen wrench to remove these.
